# sakila-demo-client

This project is intended to give an example of using OAuth2 in a client application. It is presently a simple Spring Boot application, which interacts with the applications in the following projects:
- authserver
- mysql-sakila-demo-server
There is little functionality in the project; it is just a proof-of-concept to show how to use OAuth2 within a Spring Boot client application.
